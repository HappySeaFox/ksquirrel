Now I have two main subprojects for KSquirrel:

* kdeemu - simple KDE emulator :) The main idea is to replace
  some KDE classes, which are used in KSquirrel (KFileIconView, KConfig...),
  with local copies, which won't depend on KDE. It means that these copies
  won't have some features (like dynamic file loading with KDirLister). When this
  subproject will be released, KSquirrel won't depend on KDE any more (will
  have --disable-kde option for "configure").

  Currently I ported the following KDE classes:
    - KFileIconView
    - KIconView
    - KPixmapEffect
    - KFileItem
    - KListView
    - KURL
    - KFileView
    - KLocale
    - KURLDrag
    - KFileDetailView
    - KGlobalSettings
    - KPixmap
    - KWordWrap
    - some functions from KIO

* qpixbuf - MIT-SHM widget, which will be alternative to current OpenGL image
  window. Currently it works only with 24-bit X11 mode. Uses libpixops to scale
  up/down images. When this subproject will be released, KSquirrel won't depend
  on OpenGL any more (will have --disable-opengl option for "configure"; now
  this option exists, but do nothing).

--------------------------------------------------

All these tasks need maintainer. They don't depended on KSquirrel.
