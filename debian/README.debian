ksquirrel for Debian
----------------------

  Recommended installation method is running "fakeroot debian/rules binary"
  in the top directory

  In case you would like to pass some parameters to ./configure, set variable
  DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS like that:

  krasu:~$ DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="--without-arts" fakeroot debian/rules binary
