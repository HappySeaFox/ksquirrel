KSquirrel is a new image viewer for KDE, simple and convenient in usage.

While all others use another's decoders, in KSquirrel image decoding is based on own decoders
(ksquirrel-libs) which format is very simple. If support of certain format FMT is necessary
for you, you can write the decoder for KSquirrel, compile and copy it in /usr/lib/ksquirrel-libs.
At desire you can use ksquirrel-libs in other image viewer. Since 0.6.0 ksquireel-libs has
documentation and simple examples.

Due to usage OpenGL show and a manipulation the image is characterized by extreme speed :).
Also in the program customized filters, external programs, tree, thumbnails,
extended thumbnails with the information on the image, flexible options, etc. are available.

There is some history:) 
In November, 2003, testing long time other programs on my collection of images,
I've found an awful thing - any of programs could not show ALL images.
There was no support 32-bit BMP, TGA, animated GIF, PSD, etc. Any of them does not use the
most advanced libraries for decoding images, and use either imlib, or QImage::load().
Having become dissapointed, I've decided to write the image viewer with the flexible
architecture. Birthday for KSquirrel - on December, 10, 2003. 

KSquirrel is the first viewer for KDE widely supporting such a quantity of image formats,
including Photoshop PSD, X cursors, animated GIF, FLI Animation, WMF, SVG ...
